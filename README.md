# Distribution Analysis in Python


## Overview

This project explores statistical distributions using two datasets: exam.csv and students.csv. It demonstrates statistical and visual analysis of normal and Z-distributions. The primary objective is to understand data distribution and leverage Python libraries for key statistical computations and visualizations.
## Key Features

- Load and inspect datasets.
- Visualize distributions using Seaborn.
- Compute statistical metrics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis).
- Transform normal distributions into Z-distributions.
- Explore the Central Limit Theorem with practical examples.
- Answer domain-specific questions (e.g., probabilities of specific weights).
## Technology Used

- Languages: Python
- Libraries:
Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy Statistical analysis: SciPy
Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib


## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/distribution-analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd distribution-analysis

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run

Ensure the datasets (exam.csv and students.csv) are available in the project directory.
Open the notebooks in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook

Run the cells step-by-step to reproduce the analyses.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Python for data analysis and statistical computations. Future improvements could include:

Expanding analysis to additional datasets.
Automating the generation of distribution metrics and plots.
Adding interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly.
